# ScribeMap — Interactive Visual Timeline Editor

ScribeMap is a lightweight desktop app for building branching timelines and narrative maps with an intuitive node-based canvas.

## Note

When installing, windows will warn that this file is "potentially dangerous" due to the fact that it is currently unsigned. 
The app is safe, just Windows doesn't recognize it as such.

## Download & Install (Windows)

1. Run the **ScribeMap Setup** installer.
2. Follow the prompts.

### Install Location

By default, the installer installs ScribeMap to:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ScribeMap`

This is the normal per-user install location on Windows.

If you’d like ScribeMap installed somewhere else, choose a different folder during the installer steps when it asks for the destination.

### Desktop Shortcut

The installer will automatically create a **Desktop shortcut** for ScribeMap after installation.

## Using ScribeMap (Quick Start)

* **New Timeline:** Start a fresh project from the home screen.
* **Add Nodes:** Double-click (or double-tap on touch devices) on the canvas to create a node.
* **Connect / Branch / Converge:** Use node controls to build branches and merge paths.
* **Export:** Save/share your project as a file.
* **Import:** Load a previously exported project from the home screen.

## Exported Files

ScribeMap exports timeline projects as:

* `.tmln`

You can import these files on another computer using **Import Project**.
