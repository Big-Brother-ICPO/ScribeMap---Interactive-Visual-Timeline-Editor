# ScribeMap — Interactive Visual Timeline Editor

ScribeMap is a lightweight desktop app for building branching timelines and narrative maps with an intuitive node-based canvas.

## Note

When installing, windows will warn that this file is "potentially dangerous" due to the fact that it is currently unsigned. 
The app is safe, just Windows doesn't recognize it as such.

## Download & Install (Windows)

1. Run the **ScribeMap Setup** installer.
2. There is no step two lol the setup file automatically chooses install location (see below)

### Install Location

By default, the installer installs ScribeMap to:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ScribeMap`

This is the normal per-user install location on Windows.

If you’d like ScribeMap installed somewhere else, you'll just have to cut and paste the folder from its default location to another directory.

### Desktop Shortcut

The installer will automatically create a **Desktop shortcut** for ScribeMap after installation, so you don't necessarily need to move the
folder from its default install location unless you want to keep it somewhere else (somewhere else that takes less effort to reach if you
end up using its install folder for storing your .tmln project files)

## Using ScribeMap (Quick Start)

* **New Timeline:** Start a fresh project from the home screen.
* **Add Nodes:** Double-click (or double-tap on touch devices) on the canvas to create a node.
* **Connect / Branch / Converge:** Use node controls to build branches and merge paths.
* **Export:** Save/share your project as a file.
* **Import:** Load a previously exported project from the home screen.

## Exported Files

ScribeMap exports timeline projects as:

* `.tmln`

You can import these files on another computer using **Import Project**.
